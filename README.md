# n8nWorkflows

Welcome to the **n8nWorkflows** repository â€” a modular library of automated projects built with [n8n](https://n8n.io), orchestrated and documented for quick integration.

## ðŸŽ¯ Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a central hub for collecting and documenting workflows created in the n8n environment (via Docker). Each project in the `Workflows` branch includes:

- `.json` files to import workflows into n8n  
- PDF guides detailing configuration and workflow processes  
- A `resources/` folder containing all necessary execution files

## ðŸŒ¿ `Workflows` Branch

The [`Workflows`](https://github.com/ahmed200346/n8nWorkflows/tree/Workflows) branch contains various n8n projects, each in its own folder (e.g., `Graph Rag Agent`), ready to be used and tested.

## ðŸ“¦ Repository Contents

- `README.md` *(this file)*  
- `Workflows` branch: individual n8n projects  
- PDF documentation for each project  
- Docker is required to run the workflows locally
